# Changelog

## 1.0.0

First release.

* Tiled map, seven zoom levels, 1 m/px. Rendered from world generator plus
  player terraforming (levelled ground, moats, paved roads, farmland). Trees,
  bushes, rocks as a separate overlay layer. Close-zoom tiles render only over explored ground.
  Re-render when ground changes. Worker thread, own PNG encoder, sliced
  main-thread fallback.
* Buildings as vector data per 256 m chunk: footprint, height, material,
  prefab. Drawn as material-coloured footprints with hover info.
* 3D view (three.js). Terrain from height tiles with quadtree LOD, seamless
  between tiles, clean ground tiles with tiled fine grain up close. Water.
  Players. Markers. World objects as game's own meshes: mod exports each
  prefab to glTF once (`map_data/models/`), publishes each chunk's objects
  with prefab, position, rotation, scale. Browser instances models.
* Textures pulled from the game's own asset files by the mod itself, in the
  background, on every platform. `tools/extract_textures.py` as manual
  fallback. `POST /api/reexport` rebuilds models.
* Fog of war always on. Black over unexplored ground. World locations
  (bosses, dungeons, traders) never published.
* Markers: portals with tags and links, tombstones,
  player bases (clusters of built pieces), boats, carts, custom
  `markers.json` sets.
* Export any area as a 3D scene: glTF (instanced or flat) or an Unreal pack
  with a 16-bit heightmap, CSVs and an editor script. Browser-side.
* Layer toggles drive 2D and 3D: buildings with opacity, players, chat pins,
  trees and rocks overlay (2D),
  labels, 256 m grid, marker sets, object categories.
* Stats per player: playtime, sessions, deaths, distance, portal trips,
  biomes. Per server: day, explored %, counts, online history.
* Event feed with `events.jsonl` history. Deaths carry position.
* Web app: dark UI, sidebar, search, permalinks, follow mode, mobile
  layout. No build step.
* Simple endpoints kept for scripts: `/map`, `/players`, `/pins`,
  `/messages`, `/structures`, `/forest`, `/vehicles`. Websocket speaks JSON.
* Discord webhook, `POST /announce`, chat pin commands.
